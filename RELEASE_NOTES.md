# intuiHEMS Release Notes

## v2026.03.23.1 - Configurable Location & Tibber Resilience

**Released:** March 23, 2026

### What's New

#### 📍 Configurable Geo Location
Your installation's geographic coordinates are now part of the integration config and can be edited at any time.

- **Auto-detected on setup**: Latitude, longitude, and elevation are pulled from your Home Assistant core configuration during initial setup
- **Editable in options**: Go to Configure to adjust coordinates if your HA location doesn't match your solar installation site
- **Synced to backend**: Coordinates are sent to the cloud for weather-based solar forecast accuracy

**Why this matters:** Solar forecasting uses your exact coordinates to calculate sun angles, cloud cover, and irradiance. If your HA instance uses a city-center location rather than your actual rooftop coordinates, forecast accuracy suffers. Now you can correct this without reconfiguring HA itself.

#### 🔧 Options Flow Cleanup
- User ID removed from the options screen (internal debug info, not useful to end users)
- Description updated to highlight Location & Weather configuration

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `strings.json` containing invalid JSON (mixed escaped/unescaped quotes) that could cause issues with translation loading
- Fixed broken emoji character in options description

### Backend Changes (deployed separately)
- **Tibber API timeout** increased from 10s to 30s to prevent `asyncio.TimeoutError`
- **Price fetch retry logic**: On failure, retries at 5, 10, 20, 40 minute intervals instead of waiting 24h for next cycle
- **Location API**: `/api/v1/config` endpoint now accepts latitude, longitude, elevation updates

### Upgrade Instructions
1. Update the integration via HACS or manually replace files
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to Settings → Integrations → intuiHEMS → Configure to review your location settings

### Technical Changes
- New constants: `CONF_LATITUDE`, `CONF_LONGITUDE`, `CONF_ELEVATION`
- Config flow stores location in entry data during `async_step_pricing`
- Options flow defaults to current config values, falls back to HA core location
- Backend validates: lat [-90,90], lon [-180,180], elevation [0,9000]
- 6 integration files modified: `config_flow.py`, `const.py`, `strings.json`, `translations/en.json`, `translations/de.json`, `manifest.json`

## v2026.03.05.1 - Forecast Sensor Fix & Cost-Based MPC

**Released:** March 5, 2026

### Bug Fix
- **Forecast sensor 16KB attribute overflow**: Removed `historical` key from `sensor.consumption_forecast` and `sensor.solar_forecast` attributes that was embedding ~11.5 KB of historical data, causing HA Recorder to reject attributes over 16 KB. The `forecast` array (96 × 15-min steps) is preserved for ApexCharts dashboard cards.

### Backend Changes (deployed separately)
- **Cost-based MPC optimizer**: Full CVXPY rewrite with grid export revenue, proper power balance equality constraints, and per-user feed-in price

## v2026.02.06.1 - Battery Power Monitoring & SolarEdge Refinements

**Released:** February 6, 2026

### What's New

#### 🔋 Battery Power Sensor Support
You can now configure a battery power sensor for real-time monitoring. The integration will:
- Auto-detect battery power sensors during setup
- Use the sensor for execution feedback to improve optimization accuracy
- Fall back to `sensor.battery_power` if not explicitly configured

**How to configure:** Go to Settings → Devices & Services → intuiHEMS → Configure, then select your battery power sensor from the dropdown.

#### ⚡ Improved SolarEdge Control Precision
SolarEdge inverters require power limits in 100W increments. This release ensures all power commands are properly rounded:
- New conversion function rounds to nearest 100W
- More accurate battery charge/discharge control
- Better logging shows exact Watt values sent to inverter

#### 🌐 Localized SolarEdge Mode Names
SolarEdge users with non-English HA installations can now use localized mode names:
- Integration respects your configured mode names from setup
- Example: Use "Maximaler Eigenverbrauch" instead of "Maximize Self Consumption"
- No more mode name conflicts!

### Bug Fixes
- Removed arbitrary 50kW power limit in generic battery control that could reject valid commands
- Now properly validates against your configured battery max power

### Upgrade Instructions
1. Update the integration via HACS or manually replace files
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. *(Optional)* Reconfigure to add battery power sensor: Settings → Devices & Services → intuiHEMS → Configure

### Technical Changes
- Added `CONF_BATTERY_POWER_ENTITY` configuration key
- New `kw_to_watts_rounded100()` helper function for SolarEdge
- Enhanced logging with `is_solaredge` detection and Watts display
- 4 files modified: `battery_control.py`, `config_flow.py`, `const.py`, `__init__.py`

## v2025.12.22.3

## 🐛 Critical Fix: 15-Minute Execution Timing Bug

This release fixes a critical timing issue where battery controls were executing 15 minutes late, causing missed optimization opportunities and higher energy costs.

### The Problem

- **Battery charged at wrong times**: If MPC calculated optimal charge at 10:45, battery would charge at 11:00 instead
- **Root cause**: MPC ran at quarter hours (10:45) and generated controls starting at 10:45, but by the time executor fetched them, 10:45 had passed
- **Result**: Executor would skip to next control (11:00), missing the optimal window

### The Fix

Three coordinated changes across backend and Home Assistant integration:

1. **Backend MPC Scheduler** (energy-management-service):
   - Now runs **3 minutes BEFORE** quarter hours (:42, :57, :12, :27)
   - Generates controls for the NEXT quarter hour (not current)
   - Example: MPC at 10:42 generates controls starting at 10:45

2. **Backend API** (control plan endpoint):
   - Includes controls from last 5 minutes (not just future)
   - Handles network latency and clock sync differences
   - Executor can now find controls even if fetched slightly after quarter hour

3. **HA Integration Executor**:
   - Triggers on-demand coordinator refresh before execution
   - Ensures fresh control plan data at execution time
   - Improved logging (DEBUG → INFO) for better visibility

### Impact

✅ Battery now charges/discharges at **exact optimal times** calculated by MPC  
✅ No more 15-minute delays that caused missed cheap electricity windows  
✅ Controls execute within 1 second of target time (:00, :15, :30, :45)

## 🚀 Major Feature: Automatic Battery Control

The integration now **automatically controls your battery** based on MPC optimization:

### Battery Control Executor

- Executes control decisions every 15 minutes (:00, :15, :30, :45)
- Supports three battery modes:
  - **Self Use**: Battery charges from solar, powers house loads
  - **Backup**: Battery reserved for backup power (no grid charging)
  - **Force Charge**: Active grid charging at specified power level
- Sends execution feedback to backend for closed-loop optimization
- Configurable mode mappings for different inverter brands

### Setup Configuration

Enhanced configuration flow with:
- **Battery control entity selection**: Choose work mode and charge current entities
- **Mode mapping**: Map MPC control actions to your inverter's mode names
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically finds FoxESS, SolarEdge, and other inverter entities
- **Validation**: Ensures all required entities are selected and valid

### Safety Features

- Respects battery SOC limits (min/max configured in backend)
- Allows operation even when battery is below minimum (prevents infeasibility)
- Proper unit handling: kW power setpoints converted to Amperes for FoxESS
- Only executes controls from the latest MPC run (prevents stale controls)

## 🔧 Major Improvements

### MPC Optimization

- **Grid export disabled**: Prevents unbounded optimization solutions
- **DCP-compliant constraints**: Ensures convex optimization problem
- **Solar opportunity cost**: Penalizes grid charging during solar surplus hours
- **Better handling of edge cases**: Works when battery SOC is below minimum

### Configuration UI

- **Simplified setup flow**: Removed confusing fields (update_interval, battery_discharge_power)
- **Better field descriptions**: Clear explanations for each configuration option
- **Reordered fields**: Energy sensors grouped together, battery control grouped together
- **Dropdown selectors**: All entity selections use consistent dropdown UI
- **Options flow**: Full reconfiguration without deleting/re-adding integration

### Sensor Data Collection

- **Fixed cumulative sensor handling**: Solar energy totals properly converted to power
- **Category-based queries**: Sensors queried by category instead of hardcoded IDs
- **Unit conversions**: Automatic W → kW conversion where needed
- **Outlier filtering**: Removes spurious solar spikes from data

### Timezone Handling

- **All displays in local time**: Next Control sensor shows local time (not UTC)
- **Proper timezone conversions**: Backend uses UTC, HA displays in local timezone
- **Aligned execution times**: Controls execute at exact quarter hours in user's timezone

## 📚 Documentation Updates

- **README_HA_INTEGRATION.md**: Complete installation and setup guide
- **English README.md**: HACS-ready documentation
- **Comprehensive field descriptions**: In-app help text for all configuration options
- **Architecture documentation**: System design and optimization details

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **Personalized setup flow**: Optional email opt-in for updates
- **Consent tracking**: Privacy preferences stored and respected
- **HTTPS by default**: All API communication encrypted
- **Bearer token authentication**: Secure API key handling

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed duplicate control execution from multiple MPC runs
- Fixed control timestamp alignment (quarter-hour boundaries)
- Fixed database migration conflicts in production
- Fixed sensor validation warnings for non-entity config keys
- Fixed setup flow showing no fields when auto-detection fails
- Fixed spurious PV spike data corruption
- Fixed forecast queries missing user_id filter
